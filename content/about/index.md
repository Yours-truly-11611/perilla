## About the creative director

My name is Alexandria. I have a business degree, a nearly-finished digital marketing certification, and a deep conviction that good writing should be accessible to people doing interesting work.

I've studied the frameworks; I know what AIDA stands for and when PAS beats BAB. But the people I work with don't care about any of that. They care about whether the words on their website sound like something they'd actually say. That's the bar I write to.

Years of nomadic living taught me that connection and hospitality matter more than most people admit. Whether someone lands on your website or knocks on your door, they should feel like they're in the right place. I bring that same instinct to every project.

When I'm not working, I like to hike, sail, paint, read, and explore with my kid.

## What I Believe

**Good writing is good thinking made visible.** Your website, your emails, and your social posts are all windows into how you think about your work. When the words are clear and authentic, everything else gets easier.

**Authenticity and professionalism aren't opposites.** You can be warm without being unprofessional. Direct without being harsh. Playful without being unserious.

**Creative work deserves business infrastructure.** You're not "just" an artist or a creative. You're running a business! And businesses need solid foundations: clear positioning, professional presentation, systems that work. That's not selling out. That's sustainability.

**Quality over quantity.** I take on a limited number of projects so I can give each one the attention it deserves. No assembly lines, no templates, no cutting corners.

**Collaboration over dictation.** This is YOUR business, YOUR voice, YOUR vision. My job is to help you articulate it clearly, not to impose my own aesthetic or tell you what you "should" do.

**Community over competition.** When local creatives thrive, we all benefit. I refer work I can't take. I introduce people who should know each other. I show up for other people's launches and workshops. Rising tide, all boats.

## What I Offer

I write for blogs, websites, and brands. My work tends toward the conversational-but-intelligent, accessible without being shallow. I pair strong prose with strategic thinking: SEO, content pillars, brand voice, the whole architecture of it.

## Let's Work Together

Whether you need help finding your brand voice, writing copy that doesn't make you cringe, or building a website you're actually proud to share? I'd love to hear about your project.
