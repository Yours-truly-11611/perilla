## About the creative director

I'm Alexandria Leon. I help small businesses and creatives in Thunder Bay (and beyond) find their voice and build websites that actually sound like them.

I'm a copywriter, brand strategist, and web designer. I understand what it's like to build a creative business where everyone's wearing multiple hats and figuring it out as they go.

When I'm not working, I like to hike, sail, paint, read, and explore with my kid.

### Presence is a practice

I'm drawn to things that feel free and unforced.
There's beauty everywhere if you know where to look. What fascinates me most is the tension between simple and complex, raw and refined, ordinary and mysterious. 

Staying connected to the natural world keeps me grounded and helps me trust my instincts — in life and in work.

If that's you, [get in touch today](/contact/).

## Why I Do This Work

I got into copywriting because I love finding the exact right words to communicate something complex in a way that feels simple and true.

I expanded into brand voice work because I kept seeing talented creatives freeze up when writing about themselves. They could do the work beautifully, but couldn't write about it without sounding stiff or fake.

I learned web design because I wanted to control the whole experience — words AND structure — so everything worked together seamlessly.

## What I Believe

**Good writing is good thinking made visible.** Your website, your emails, and your social posts are all windows into how you think about your work. When the words are clear and authentic, everything else gets easier.

**Your website should work for you, not the other way around.** It should attract the right clients, answer their questions, and convert them, all while you're sleeping, making your art, or living your actual life.

**Authenticity and professionalism aren't opposites.** You can be warm without being unprofessional. Direct without being harsh. Playful without being unserious.

**Creative work deserves business infrastructure.** You're not "just" an artist or a creative. You're running a business! And businesses need solid foundations: clear positioning, professional presentation, systems that work. That's not selling out. That's sustainability.

**Quality over quantity.** I take on a limited number of projects so I can give each one the attention it deserves. No assembly lines, no templates, no cutting corners.

**Collaboration over dictation.** This is YOUR business, YOUR voice, YOUR vision. My job is to help you articulate it clearly — not to impose my own aesthetic or tell you what you "should" do.

**Education over gatekeeping.** I teach you how to update your own website. I explain why I'm making the choices I'm making. I share resources freely. The goal isn't to make you dependent on me — it's to empower you.

**Community over competition.** When local creatives thrive, we all benefit. I refer work I can't take. I introduce people who should know each other. I show up for other people's launches and workshops. Rising tide, all boats.

## What I Offer

I write for blogs, websites, and brands. My work tends toward the conversational-but-intelligent, accessible without being shallow. I pair strong prose with strategic thinking: SEO, content pillars, brand voice, the whole architecture of it.

## Let's Work Together

Whether you need help finding your brand voice, writing copy that doesn't make you cringe, or building a website you're actually proud to share? I'd love to hear about your project.
