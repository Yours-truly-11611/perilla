## Hi, I'm Alexandria

I'm a freelance copywriter and content strategist based in Thunder Bay, Ontario. I specialize in travel writing, digital nomad lifestyle content, and creative business storytelling — and I bring a visual edge to everything I do through watercolor illustration.

## How I got here

After two years of minimalist backpacking travel — everything I owned fit in a 32-liter pack — I started writing about the experience. What began as personal journaling turned into a body of work I'm genuinely proud of: practical guides, personal essays, and the occasional piece of longform narrative that explores what it means to move through the world with very little and pay very close attention.

Now I'm stateside (well, Canada-side) again, raising a small human, and building a freelance practice that lets me keep writing about the things I care about.

## What I offer

I write for blogs, websites, and brands. My work tends toward the conversational-but-intelligent — accessible without being shallow. I pair strong prose with strategic thinking: SEO, content pillars, brand voice, the whole architecture of it.

I also illustrate. Watercolors, mostly. If you want words *and* visuals, I'm your person.
