Here are the books I completed in 2025. (Work in Progress)

I was surprised to see that I only finished 3 books that are fiction/sci-fi. Many more were started, including a book of Roland Dahl’s short stories and a collection by Terry Pratchet, but I have yet to finish the whole book so they’ll go on next year’s list.

# **Fiction**

*SPOILERS*

## *Flowers for Algernon* by Daniel Keyes

I loved how the writing style evolved and changed as the character’s mental capacity grew and shrank. Didn’t like how he wrote the women characters, but that style is pretty standard for the time, so I don’t hold it against him. Great story and concept.

## *The Idiot* by Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Strong start. The best part was when the sick kid gave his big speech at the party. After that, it felt like everything fell off… I always love how Dostoyevsky is able to capture interpersonal relationships and individual character.

## *Butter* by Asako Yuzuki

Fun! Japanese contemporary fiction about a journalist discovering her own preferences (and the importance of having preferences) by interviewing an alleged serial killer/food blogger. I enjoyed this thoroughly as a lighter read while continuing to slog through some particularly heavy non-fiction books.

# **Non-fiction**

## *Outlive* by Peter Attia

Lots of food for though about my own well-being. I was afraid that it would be about longevity in the way some people do anything to prevent ageing, but this was not the case. It is focused on the quality of life as well as the length, and explicitly says that a longer life isn’t worth having if the quality of it is poor.

## *Hyperculture* by Byung Chul Han

Helped my better understand my own critique of worries surrounding cultural appropriation. A fascinating exploration on the consequences on culture of our digitally connected world.

## *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss

A guide for negotiation that captures the reader with wild stories and applicable lessons. The techniques and principles described have already improved my negotiating skills with my toddler, husband, and Samsung’s help desk.

## *The Pocket Butler’s Guide to Good Housekeeping* by Charles MacPherson

A helpful handbook for housekeeping. My favorite section was about laundry and effective home-made cleaning supplies.

## *The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up* by Marie Kondo

After reading this, I finally got rid of a bunch of stuff that was cluttering my space, and thus, cluttering my mind. Following the advice from this book to tidy my home has helped me think more clearly in my now cleaner space.

## *Carnival of Snackery* by David Sedaris

Selected diary entries from acclaimed comedy writer David Sedaris. A relatable and funny read, as I also keep a diary.

## *Ultralight Backpacking Tips* by Mike Clelland

A charming compilation of ultralight camping tips with hand drawn illustrations and casual style. I have already applied several tips to my method of travel, even though I am travelling more often on a plane between cities than into the woods with a tent.

## *The Ultimate Hang* by Derek Hansen

I dream of making my camp set-up ultralight as well, and this book went into the details of camping with a hammock and tarp.

## *No Bad Kids* by Janet Lansbury

Practical advice on how to deal with a toddler and yourself.

## *Making Things: Finding use, meaning, and Satisfaction in Creating Everyday Objects* by Erin Boyle and Rose Pearlman

An actually useful and inventive book on how to reuse things gracefully. Tutorials on how to make beautiful and practical things that deviates from the typical „reduce reuse recycle aesthetic“.

## *How Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids* by Jaycee Dunn

Incredibly helpful as a young mother.

## *The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst* by Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall

Like watching a car crash in slow motion.

## *Secrets of Adulthood* by Gretchen Rubin



## *Common Sense Natural Beekeeping* by Kim Flottum



## *Letters of Note: Art* by Shaun Usher



## *Picture This: How Pictures Work* by Molly Bang

Changed how I consider the compositions of my art pieces. Very helpful and an easy read.

## *The E-Myth Revisited* by Michael E. Gerber

A classic book for entrepreneurs that is generally useful for anyone trying to build an organizational structure. Highlights the importance of defined roles and potential delegation.
