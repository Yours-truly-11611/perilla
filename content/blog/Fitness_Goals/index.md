„Wellness“ encompasses the state of both my „metals“ and „physicals“.

I’m going to try to segment my wellness into the following parts:
- physical
- emotional
- intellectual 
- social 
- spiritual 

„Mental health“ could encompass the last four categories that I mention, but it seems too broad a topic that I decided to divvy it up some more.

## Physical health 

The importance of physical fitness has recently become apparent to me as I continue to recover from my old injuries and first pregnancy.

### What I Want to Be Able To Do
- Practice martial arts safely.
- Hike another 14ner.
- Keep up with my kids.
- Feel confident in a swimsuit.
- Avoid having to buy a new wardrobe for as long as possible.
- Take long walks through new places.
- Help out on the boat, hosting sails, etc.
- Be confident in my ability to swim if I fall overboard.
- Carry my canoe and gear through portages alone.
- Bounce back from injury and pregnancy as easily as I can make it.

**But First:**
- 3 pull-ups (1 pull-up even!)
- 2 min plank
- 20 straight push-ups

**Key Areas of Improvement**
- Anterior pelvic tilt, which is just beginning to cause back pain
- Old knee injury. Gotta make my joints strong.
- Cardio that’s easy on my knees.
- Rebuilding core after invasive abdominal surgery.

### Current Routines
I’m interested in “functional fitness”.

**Anterior Pelvic Tilt**
*For each exercise, two 30 second reps, with as many sets you can squeeze in. 1-2 sets is most likely*
- Child’s pose
- Glute bridges with kicks
- Clamshells 
- Cat/Cow
- Plank
- Bird/Dog 
- Lunge stretches 

**Strong Knees**
- Squats
- Kettlebell swings
- Calf raises
- Step up with knee raises

**Core**
- Bird/Dog
- Plank
- Dead bugs
- Mountain climbers
- Side leg raises

**Flexibility**
- Not really sure, sun salutation yoga flows perhaps?

## Emotional Health
The classic „mental health“ category.
## Intellectual Health
Am I learning and being intellectually stimulated on a regular basis?
## Social Health
How healthy are my relationships to other people?
## Spiritual Health
What does this mean exactly? Not so sure, but if „spiritual abuse“ is a real thing than spiritual health must be, too.
