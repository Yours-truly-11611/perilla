I would call myself naturally more introverted. 

I used to spend hours happily writing inside my private notebooks, never opening up to others about the deep things.

But, introspection can only get you so far.

You're too close to yourself. You can't see the lenses and models you use to make sense of the world because you're too busy seeing with them.

You can't examine a pair of glasses while you're wearing them.

Communication with others is the best way to make sense of how you make sense of things (super meta).

In fact, this blog is one of the ways I hope to connect with others.
