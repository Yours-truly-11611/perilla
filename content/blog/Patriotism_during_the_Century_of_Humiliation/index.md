Right now, it is December 2025, in the midst of the second Trump administration. I live in Canada. Criticizing the USA and it’s inhabitants is as easy and as common as talking about the weather. Wearing any semblance of Stars and Stripes flags you as some kind of bigot.

I am not a fan of the president, but I am also reluctant to condemn him or his supporters, and I am certainly stubbornly hopeful for the future of my home country.

## A Patriot, not a Nationalist
I love my country and that means I hold it to the highest standards. I would consider myself an American patriot.

Let’s first disentangle „State“ from „Nation“.

Now, what does it mean to be a patriot? A nationalist? Are they the same thing?

No.

The key difference is being able to look critically at one’s own country.

## An American Expat
Though I currently live in Canada, I have spent much time in other countries, such as Germany, Taiwan, and Australia.

Moving to another country can never „wash away“ my Americanism, and nor would I want it to. In fact, relocating outside of Anerica only highlights the aspects of myself that are undeniably „made in the USA“, and these are often traits that I am proud of.

I currently live in Canada, the USA‘s northern neighbour. It’s not easy to live in a country that loves to hate where I come from.

What does it mean to love my country even now?

Yes, Trump’s actions and statements are incredibly embarrassing.

Yes, I abhor how devisive his rhetoric is, and how he often dehumanizes anyone he perceives as an opponent or threat.

But, this can’t last forever.
