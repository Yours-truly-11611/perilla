*Isn’t keeping a blog a bit… egocentric?*

I mean it could be but it doesn’t have to be. What matters is the purpose. For instance, I blog as a means to reclaim my online experience. I don’t post so much on social media because I have this space that’s completely mine- no tracking, to ads, no weird internet politics. I built this thing myself so I know exactly what’s going on behind the scenes. You can’t say that about any social media site or really anything else if you didn’t build it yourself.

*Okay, that sounds kinda cool, but why do you think anyone would want to read anything you write anyway?*

Me posting my thoughts on the internet is less about people reading it and more about sending an open broadcast of personal expression, in the same way someone might wear a niche band t-shirt in public.

They aren’t necessarily wearing the shirt so that a stranger will come and appreciate it. More likely, they bought it because they like it, and if someone does compliment it, they’ve found a new potential friend. But that only works if you put your interests out there.

*So it’s a bid for attention?*

Maybe partly so, but certainly not overly so in my opinion. If I wanted attention I’d go and post things on popular social media networks or go out into the street naked with a megaphone. Extreme example, but does it get the point across?

*Maybe but I’m not sure because I’m you.*

Fair enough.
