summary: Visiting the place my family came from didn't answer the questions I thought it would. It asked better ones.

---


I was twenty-six when I first went to Greece. Not the Greece of tourists — the whitewashed islands, the sunsets over the Aegean, all of that. I went to a small town in the northern interior where my father grew up, where his mother still lived in a house with thick stone walls and a garden full of things I couldn't name.

I went because I wanted to understand something about myself. Where I came from. What it meant that my last name sounded like it did, that my skin was olive-toned in a way that didn't quite fit anywhere in the Midwest town where I grew up.

I didn't find what I was looking for. What I found was better.

## What the town looked like

It was small — maybe a thousand people, maybe fewer. The kind of place where everyone knew your grandmother and would tell you so, unprompted, at the hardware store. The streets were narrow and paved unevenly. Dogs slept in the middle of the road and nobody honked.

My grandmother's house smelled like oregano and wood smoke. She fed me constantly — bread, cheese, olives, meat that had been cooking since morning. She spoke to me in Greek and I understood maybe a third of it, which was more than I'd understood before I came and less than I wanted.

## The thing about roots

Here is what I thought visiting would feel like: a homecoming. A click of recognition. The sense of *oh, this is where I belong.*

Here is what it actually felt like: curiosity. A deep, warm, slightly bewildered curiosity about this place and these people who were connected to me by blood and almost nothing else. I didn't speak their language. I didn't know their customs. I had grown up eating cereal for breakfast and watching American television and thinking of myself, mostly, as American.

And yet.

There was something in the way my grandmother looked at me — a recognition that had nothing to do with language or culture or shared experience. It was simpler than that. It was: *you are mine. You are ours. You are here.*

## What I brought back

I brought back a jar of oregano from her garden. A photograph of the town square. A feeling I still can't quite name — something between gratitude and grief, something that surfaces sometimes when I'm cooking or when my daughter does something with her hands that looks exactly like something my father used to do.

I'm not Greek, exactly. I'm not American, exactly. I'm something in between — something that doesn't have a clean word for it, something that lives in the hyphen.

And I think that's okay. I think the hyphen is where the interesting writing lives.
