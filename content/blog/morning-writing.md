My daughter wakes up at 6:15, give or take. Some mornings it's 5:50 and I hear her talking to herself through the baby monitor, a long monologue in a language that isn't quite English yet. Other mornings she sleeps until almost 7 and I feel like I've been given an unexpected gift.

The gift is the silence before her. The forty-five minutes — sixty if I'm lucky — when the house is still dark and the coffee is still hot and nobody needs anything from me.

This is when I write.

## Why this window and not another

I tried evening writing for years. After dinner, after the dishes, after whatever the day had left on the table. It never worked. By evening my brain had already spent itself — on decisions, on conversations, on the low-grade vigilance that comes with being a parent of a small child. What was left wasn't enough to make something good.

Morning is different. Morning is the part of the day when my mind is still quiet enough to hear itself think. Before the notifications, before the email, before the thousand tiny negotiations that make up an ordinary day. There's a clarity to it that I've come to depend on.

## What I actually do in that window

Not much, by any external measure. I make coffee. I sit down. I open a document — usually something I started the day before, or a thread I've been pulling at for a week. And I write.

Sometimes it flows. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I delete more than I keep. But I show up, and I put words on the page, and by the time I hear the monitor crackle to life I have *something*. A paragraph. A page. An idea that wasn't there when I sat down.

## The discipline of it

People ask me how I find time to write with a toddler at home. The honest answer is: I don't find it. I make it. I protect it. I treat those early morning hours the way a surgeon treats their hands — carefully, deliberately, with a clear sense of what they're for.

This means I don't check my phone before I write. It means I don't open email. It means I sometimes let the coffee get lukewarm because I was in the middle of a sentence and didn't want to break the thread.

It's a small discipline. But it's the one that makes everything else possible.
