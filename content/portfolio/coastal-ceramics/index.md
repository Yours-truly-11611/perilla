Developed full site copy for a small-batch ceramics studio: homepage, about, shop descriptions, and a blog post on their process. The brief called for something warm and handmade-feeling without tipping into precious.

## The Brief

Coastal Ceramics needed a complete website rewrite. Their existing copy was functional but flat — it described what they made without conveying why it mattered. They wanted language that felt like the objects themselves: tactile, honest, a little rough around the edges.

## What I Did

I spent a day in the studio watching the process, taking notes, and talking to the makers. That visit shaped everything. The copy I wrote leans on sensory detail and process language — the weight of wet clay, the unpredictability of glazes, the patience required for a kiln firing.

## Deliverables

- Homepage copy
- About page
- 12 product descriptions
- 1 blog post on their process
