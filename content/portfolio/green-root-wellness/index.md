Built a 12-month content calendar organized around four seasonal pillars. Included keyword research, audience personas, and a brand voice guide the team could use to write consistently without me.

## The Brief

Green Root Wellness is a small naturopathic clinic that had been posting to their blog sporadically and without a clear strategy. They wanted a plan they could follow independently — something structured enough to be useful but flexible enough to adapt to what was actually happening in the business.

## What I Did

I started with an audit of their existing content and analytics, then developed four seasonal content pillars tied to their service calendar. Each pillar included topic clusters, target keywords, and suggested formats. I also wrote a brand voice guide and three sample posts to set the tone.

## Deliverables

- 12-month content calendar
- Keyword map (60+ terms)
- Brand voice guide
- 3 sample blog posts
