Wrote a six-piece series on solo travel in Southeast Asia for an independent travel publication. Each piece combined personal narrative with practical advice, targeting an audience of experienced travelers looking for something more than surface-level guides.

## Website Copy — *Coastal Ceramics Studio*

## Content Strategy — *Green Root Wellness*

Built a 12-month content calendar organized around four seasonal pillars. Included keyword research, audience personas, and a brand voice guide the team could use to write consistently without me.

*Deliverables: Content calendar, keyword map, brand voice guide, 3 sample posts*

## Illustrated Essay — *The Weight of Water*

A personal essay exploring the relationship between grief and swimming, illustrated with watercolors. Published in a literary magazine with a print run of 500.

*Deliverables: 3,000-word essay, 4 watercolor illustrations*
