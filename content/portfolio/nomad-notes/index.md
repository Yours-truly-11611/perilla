Developed a quarterly editorial plan for a digital nomad community blog, including topic clusters, contributor guidelines, and an SEO audit of existing content.

## The Brief

Nomad Notes had a library of over 200 posts accumulated over three years, but no editorial strategy tying them together. Traffic was declining and contributors were writing whatever they felt like. They needed structure without killing the community feel.

## What I Did

I audited the existing content library, identified the top-performing posts and the gaps, and organized everything into topic clusters. I then built a quarterly calendar with a mix of evergreen and timely content, wrote contributor guidelines to maintain voice consistency, and flagged 30+ posts for SEO updates.

## Deliverables

- Quarterly editorial calendar
- SEO audit report (200+ posts reviewed)
- Contributor style guide
- 30 posts flagged for optimization
