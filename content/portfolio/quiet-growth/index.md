A personal collection of watercolor studies focused on houseplants, herbs, and wildflowers. Exhibited at a local gallery and sold as a limited-edition print set.

## The Project

Quiet Growth started as a daily practice — one small painting per day for a month, each focused on a single plant. The constraint forced me to pay closer attention to details I usually skip: the way a leaf curls at the edge, the specific green where a stem meets soil, the geometry of a seed head.

## The Exhibition

After the month was up, I selected twelve pieces for a small exhibition at a community gallery in Thunder Bay. The prints sold as a boxed set of twelve cards, and several originals found homes.

## Deliverables

- 12 watercolor illustrations
- Print-ready files for card set
- Exhibition-ready framed originals
