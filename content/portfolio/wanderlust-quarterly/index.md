Wrote a six-piece series on solo travel in Southeast Asia for an independent travel publication. Each piece combined personal narrative with practical advice, targeting an audience of experienced travelers looking for something more than surface-level guides.

## The Brief

Wanderlust Quarterly wanted longform essays that went beyond the usual "top 10 things to do" format. They were looking for voice-driven pieces that could sit alongside literary travel writing while still being useful to readers planning trips.

## What I Did

I pitched a six-part series organized around a single overland route from Bangkok to Hanoi, with each essay anchored to a specific place and a specific theme — slowness, food, solitude, language barriers, the ethics of tourism, and the experience of returning home.

Each piece ran between 2,000 and 3,500 words. I handled SEO keyword strategy for the series and wrote social media captions for promotion across Instagram and Twitter.

## Deliverables

- 6 longform essays (2,000–3,500 words each)
- SEO keyword strategy
- Social media captions
