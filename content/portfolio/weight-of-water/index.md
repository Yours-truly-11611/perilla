A personal essay exploring the relationship between grief and swimming, illustrated with watercolors. Published in a literary magazine with a print run of 500.

## The Project

This was a self-initiated piece — something I'd been carrying around for a while. The essay explores how swimming became a way of processing grief after losing someone close, and how water holds a particular kind of memory.

## The Illustrations

I created four watercolor illustrations to accompany the text: a figure submerged, a surface seen from below, hands breaking water, and an empty pool at dusk. The palette is muted blues and grays with flashes of warm ochre.

## Deliverables

- 3,000-word personal essay
- 4 watercolor illustrations
- Print-ready files for magazine layout
