## My Approach

I write the way I'd want to be written to: clear, warm, and honest. No jargon. No fluff. Just good sentences that do their job.

I'm especially drawn to projects in travel, lifestyle, wellness, and creative business — but I'm always open to a conversation if you think we might be a good fit.

## My Services

### Copywriting that sounds like you

I write website copy, service descriptions, email sequences, and marketing content that converts visitors into clients while still sounding authentically like YOU. No corporate jargon. No generic "solutions provider" nonsense.

This is for you if:

- You know what you want to say but can't find the words
- Your website copy was written at 2am in a panic and it shows
- You've been using the same tired bio for three years
- You're launching something new and need copy that converts

I can write:

- Website copy (homepage, about, services, contact) | $200 per page
- Hero banners (Headline, subheadline, CTA) | $100 each
- Email sequences (welcome, launch, nurture, newsletters) | $100 per email
- Blog posts & articles | $100 each
- Product descriptions | $0.25 per word (since description length can vary widely)
- Instagram carousel | $75 each (writing only), $100 if including design
- LinkedIn post | $50 each
