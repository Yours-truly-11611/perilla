I write website copy, blog content, and brand messaging for creative entrepreneurs, lifestyle brands, and small businesses who need strategic storytelling—not corporate speak.

## My Services

### Copywriting that sounds like you

This is for you if:

- You know what you want to say but can't find the words
- Your website copy was written at 2am in a panic and it shows
- You've been using the same tired bio for three years
- You're launching something new and need copy that converts

I can write:

- Website copy (homepage, about, services, contact) | $200 per page
- Hero banners (Headline, subheadline, CTA) | $100 each
- Email sequences (welcome, launch, nurture, newsletters) | $100 per email
- Blog posts & articles | $100 each
- Product descriptions | $0.25 per word (since description length can vary widely)
- Instagram carousel | $75 each (writing only), $100 if including design
- LinkedIn post | $50 each

## My Approach

I write the way I'd want to be written to: clear, warm, and honest. No jargon. No fluff. Just good sentences that do their job.

I'm especially drawn to projects in travel, lifestyle, wellness, and creative business, but I'm always open to a conversation if you think we might be a good fit.
