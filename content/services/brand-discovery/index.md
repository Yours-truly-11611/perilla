## Find your voice

Before the words come, we need to understand who you are, who you're talking to, and what makes you different. Brand discovery is where that clarity begins.

## What's included

### Discovery Sessions
One-on-one conversations to explore your brand's history, values, audience, and aspirations. I ask the questions that get to the heart of what you do and why it matters.

### Brand Voice Guide
A documented guide to how your brand sounds — tone, vocabulary, personality. Something your whole team can reference to stay consistent.

### Messaging Framework
Core messages, taglines, and positioning statements that capture your brand essence and give you a foundation for all future content.

## Who this is for

Brand discovery is ideal if you're:
- Starting a new business and need to define your voice from scratch
- Rebranding and want clarity before diving into new copy
- Growing your team and need documented guidelines everyone can follow
