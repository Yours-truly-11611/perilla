## A plan you can actually follow

Great content doesn't happen by accident. It takes intention, structure, and a clear understanding of who you're talking to and why.

## What I offer

### Content Audits
A thorough look at what you've got: what's working, what's not, what's missing. You'll walk away with a clear picture and actionable next steps.

### Editorial Calendars
A realistic publishing plan built around your goals, capacity, and audience. Not a wish list — an actual roadmap.

### SEO Strategy
Keywords, structure, and sustainable organic growth. I help you get found by the people who are already looking for what you offer.

## My approach

I believe in strategy that serves the work, not the other way around. The goal isn't to produce more content — it's to produce the *right* content, consistently.

I'll help you figure out what to say, when to say it, and how to make it findable.
