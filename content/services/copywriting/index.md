## Words that work

Good copy does more than fill space — it connects, convinces, and converts. I write for brands and businesses who want to sound like themselves, only clearer.

## What I offer

### Website Copy
Homepage, about page, service pages, landing pages. The foundational words that tell visitors who you are and why they should care.

### Blog Posts & Articles
SEO-optimized content that sounds like a human wrote it. Thought leadership, how-to guides, and storytelling that builds trust over time.

### Email Sequences
Nurture campaigns, newsletters, product launches. Words that land in inboxes and actually get read.

### Brand Voice Development
Finding the words that sound like *you*. A documented voice and tone guide your whole team can use.

## My approach

I write the way I'd want to be read: clear, warm, and honest. No jargon. No fluff. Just good sentences that do their job.

Every project starts with listening — to you, to your audience, to what's already working and what's not.
