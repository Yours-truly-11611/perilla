## Copywriting tat sounds like you

### Hand over the blank page paralysis — I'll write it for you

You know what you want to say, but the words won't come. Or worse, when you try to write your About page, you sound like a committee of anxious robots.

I write website copy, service descriptions, email sequences, and marketing content that converts visitors into clients while still sounding authentically like YOU. No corporate jargon. No generic "solutions provider" nonsense.


This is for you if:

- You know what you want to say but can't find the words
- Your website copy was written at 2am in a panic and it shows
- You've been using the same tired bio for three years
- You're launching something new and need copy that converts

I can write:

- Website copy (homepage, about, services, contact) | $200 per page
- Email sequences (welcome, launch, nurture, newsletters) 
- Blog posts & articles | $100 each
- Product descriptions | $5 each
- Social media content (batched captions) | $150 for 30 instagram posts
- Service guides and one-pagers

## My approach

I write the way I'd want to be read: clear, warm, and honest. No jargon. No fluff. Just good sentences that do their job.

Every project starts with listening. To you, to your audience, to what's already working and what's not.

**Investment:**
- $200 for individual web pages (home page, about me, etc.)
- $100 per blog post
- $100 per email
- $15 per social media post
- $100 per 15-30 second motion graphic video
- $20 per social media ad
