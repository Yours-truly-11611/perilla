## Art with intention

I create watercolor illustrations for brands, publications, and personal commissions. Each piece is painted by hand, then digitized for flexible use across web and print.

## What I offer

### Watercolor Illustration
Original artwork for websites, products, editorial, and print. Botanicals, landscapes, portraits, and abstract work.

### Custom Artwork
Commissioned pieces for personal or commercial use. Perfect for gifts, home decor, or adding a human touch to your brand.

### Brand Assets
Icons, patterns, spot illustrations, and visual elements that bring warmth and texture to your digital presence.

## My approach

I work in a loose, expressive style — soft edges, rich color, a sense of light. My illustrations feel handmade because they are.

Every commission starts with a conversation about what you're looking for, followed by sketches, feedback, and final artwork you'll love.
