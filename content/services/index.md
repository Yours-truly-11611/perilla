## What I Do

I help brands and businesses tell their stories through thoughtful copywriting, content strategy, and original illustration.

## My Approach

I write the way I'd want to be written to: clear, warm, and honest. No jargon. No fluff. Just good sentences that do their job.

I'm especially drawn to projects in travel, lifestyle, wellness, and creative business — but I'm always open to a conversation if you think we might be a good fit.
