## What I Do

I help brands and businesses tell their stories through thoughtful copywriting, content strategy, and original illustration.

### Copywriting

- **Website copy** — Homepage, about page, service pages, landing pages
- **Blog posts & articles** — SEO-optimized content that sounds like a human wrote it
- **Email sequences** — Nurture campaigns, newsletters, launches
- **Brand voice development** — Finding the words that sound like *you*

### Content Strategy

- **Content audits** — What's working, what's not, what's missing
- **Editorial calendars** — A plan you can actually follow
- **SEO strategy** — Keywords, structure, and sustainable organic growth

### Illustration

- **Watercolor illustration** — For websites, products, and print
- **Custom artwork** — Portraits, landscapes, botanical work
- **Brand assets** — Icons, patterns, and visual elements

## My Approach

I write the way I'd want to be written to: clear, warm, and honest. No jargon. No fluff. Just good sentences that do their job.

I'm especially drawn to projects in travel, lifestyle, wellness, and creative business — but I'm always open to a conversation if you think we might be a good fit.
